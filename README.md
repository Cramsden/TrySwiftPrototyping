## Setup
### Server
We are using a simple npm server to serve up `JSON`. To use:
- `cd server`
- `npm start`

### Xcode projects
There are 2 avaliable Xcode projects:
- TrySwiftPrototype: A project using SwiftUI
- TrySwiftPrototype2: A project using UIKit

On the master branch you should find a barebones app in which the networking layer has already been built out and the data is being stored in codable objects that represent these api objects. 

We also went through and built a prototype based on this use case. If you are looking for more insperation feel free to check out `prototype_done` for our final product!
